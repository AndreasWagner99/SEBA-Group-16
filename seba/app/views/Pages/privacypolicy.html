<h3>Privacy Policy </h3>
<hr>
<p>This License applies to any program or other work which contains 
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below, 
  refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another 
  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br />
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<ol>
  <li>  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's 
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the 
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
    along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</li>
  <li> You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion 
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    <ul>
      <li> You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. </li>
      <li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any 
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
        parties under the terms of this License.</li>
      <li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively 
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a 
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide 
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under 
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br />
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on 
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</li>
      <li>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If 
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
        and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
        themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
        sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
        distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
        on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
        this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
        entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</li>
      <li>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
        your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
        exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
        collective works based on the Program.</li>
      <li>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
        with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of 
        a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
        the scope of this License.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
