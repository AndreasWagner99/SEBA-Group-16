  refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another 
  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br />
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
